# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and elegant To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can add, complete, and delete tasks — with data saved in `localStorage`.

This is my first full project as I transition into a Fullstack Developer role.  
It demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic data persistence.
